# simple-show-archiver

A simple bash script to archive shows. By default the URL is for stonehenge.
To download other shows, go to https://www.wrek.org/schedule/, mouseover a desired show, and copy the 128k URL and use it to replace the stonehenge url. You also may need to change the download file path to something you want for your system.

You can also [create a cron job](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto) to run this script weekly
